**Parameters:**
- `owner` (string): Repository owner
- `repo` (string): Repository name
- `pull_number` (number): Pull request number
- `include_security` (boolean, optional): Include security analysis (default: true)
- `include_best_practices` (boolean, optional): Include best practices recommendations (default: true)
- `severity_threshold` (string, optional): Minimum severity level to report - "low", "medium", "high", or "critical" (default: "medium")

**Example:**
```

```

#### 3. `analyze_code_diff`
Analyze specific code changes for issues and security vulnerabilities.

**Parameters:**
- `diff_content` (string): Git diff content to analyze
- `file_path` (string): Path of the file being analyzed
- `language` (string, optional): Programming language (auto-detected if not provided)
- `include_security` (boolean, optional): Include security analysis (default: true)

**Example:**
```
Analyze this diff for security issues:
```diff
+function validateUser(input) {

+}
```

#### 4. `get_repository_prs`
List pull requests for a repository with filtering options.

**Parameters:**
- `owner` (string): Repository owner
- `repo` (string): Repository name
- `state` (string, optional): PR state filter - "open", "closed", or "all" (default: "open")
- `limit` (number, optional): Maximum number of PRs to return (default: 10, max: 100)
- `sort` (string, optional): Sort criteria - "created", "updated", "popularity", or "long-running" (default: "created")

## Security Analysis

The server detects various security issues including:

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use of `eval()` and similar dangerous functions
- XSS vulnerabilities via `innerHTML`
- Unsafe `setTimeout` usage
- TypeScript `any` type usage
- Hardcoded secrets and API keys

### Python
- Use of `exec()` and `eval()`
- Unsafe `pickle` usage
- Bare `except` clauses
- Input validation issues

### PHP
- SQL injection patterns
- Use of dangerous functions
- Unvalidated superglobal usage

### General
- Hardcoded passwords and API keys
- Commented-out code
- TODO/FIXME markers
- Long lines and code complexity

## Code Quality Assessment

The analyzer evaluates:

- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity based on decision points
- **Maintainability**: Score based on line count, complexity, and readability
- **Duplicate Code**: Detection of repeated code patterns
- **Best Practices**: Language-specific coding standards
- **File Risk**: Assessment based on file types and patterns

## Risk Assessment

Each PR receives an overall risk rating:

- **Low**: Minor issues, safe to merge
- **Medium**: Some issues present, review recommended
- **High**: Security concerns or multiple issues
- **Critical**: Serious issues that block merging
